This Plugin brings reCAPTCHA integration to mautic 5.

## Installation

### mautic 5
Supports reCaptcha v3.

Add this code to the plugins/ directory of your mautic installation.

Install Google cloud recaptcha package

```
composer require google/cloud-recaptcha-enterprise` # in the main directory of the mautic installation.
```

Put plugin in plugins directory
```
cd <mautic-root>/plugins
git clone <url> MauticRecaptchaBundle
# clear the cache rm -rf var/cache/dev/* var/cache/prod/*
php bin/console mautic:plugins:reload --env=prod
```

> @todo needs to be moved to the plugins composer.json, when we support composer v2. So we can install the https://github.com/mautic/composer-plugin.


## Configuration

Navigate to the Plugins page and click "Install/Upgrade Plugins". You should now see a "reCAPTCHA" plugin. Open it to enable it.

Set the following ENV variables on your server:
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
- GC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY
- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

The plugin relies on [Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha). For it to work it needs [Google Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC). 

## Usage in a Mautic Form
Add "reCAPTCHA" field to the Form and save changes.

## Score validation

reCAPTCHA v3 will rank traffic and interactions based on a score of 0.0 to 1.0, with a 1.0 being a good interaction and scores closer to 0.0 indicating a good likelihood that the traffic was generated by bots
